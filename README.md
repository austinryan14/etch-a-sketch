Making an etch-a-sketch/sketchpad hybrid.

I started to try to make the grid using Flexbox, but that didn't end up working out. I couldn't get the squares to fit in a fixed space; the grid kept expanding depending on the size of the grid. I ended up switching to Grid layout, which was much easier.

I got a better grasp on some JavaScript functions that weren't fully explained earlier. Like how forEach() returns a list and I have to iterate through it. What's confusing is there are several ways to do one thing, which may seem great but is confusing to learn at first because I end up mixing up syntax and it doesn't work, but I'm getting the hang of it.

I also had a whole delete function that removed the child element from every div, then I discovered the innerHtml method, which is way simpler. 

I also struggled with the Reset prompt. There are still some ways to break it, and I didn't want to mess with the Cancel button just yet, but it gets the job done for now.

Overall I'm failry content with this. As usual could've done a lot more to style it and make it look prettier.
